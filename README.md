# Notebooks for exploring different timing recovery algorithms

Three notebooks for three (and a half) timing recovery methods:
- Early-Late Gate
- Gardner (and Zero-Crossing)
- Mueller & Muller

Each is implemented as an all-software PLL-like architecture (similar to the Costas loop for carrier recovery). Click the notebooks to learn more about how they work!
